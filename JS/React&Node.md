A component can receive some parameters (props)

JSX

Every react element is a JS object, it can be save in variable or pass as parameters.

<shopList /> represents whole shupList react components.
<shopList xxx=???> xxx can get from shopList->this.props.

In React, data pass via props, from Parent components to child components.

Invoke setState in component evert time. React'll refresh child components.

when we need multiple child components, need to put the child components' state higher to parent component. Then state can be passed by props.

When the state of Board changed, all squares will be re-rendered.

Any update of **state** or **props** will cause re-rendering of React.
