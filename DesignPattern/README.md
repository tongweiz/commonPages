## Creational Pattern
* Simple Factory Pattern
* Factory Pattern
  * Simple factory method take heavy responsibility. Every product is created by same method. If new product coming, need to update factory method. Obey the **Closure** principle
* Abstract Factory Pattern
  * Every AbsFactory.Factory only produce one product in AbsFactory.Factory, abstract several products to a product cluster
* Singleton Pattern Pattern
  * Static internal class
* Prototype Pattern
  * Shallow Clone and Deep Clone
  * Prototype Manager
* Builder Pattern
  * Return a complicated product that composed by multiple components
  * If abstract factory is car components producer, builder pattern is a car build factory, build a car by compose different car parts.
